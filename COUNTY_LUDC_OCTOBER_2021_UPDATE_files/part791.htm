Purpose and intent. <span class="p">This Section provides regulations for surface mining operations in compliance with the California Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975 (Public Resources Code Section 2710 et seq.),</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">hereinafter referred to as SMARA; Public Resources Code Section 2207; and California Code of Regulations, Title 14, Section 3500 et seq., to ensure that:</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">1.   Adverse environmental effects to be prevented or minimized. <span class="p">The adverse environmental effects of surface mining operations will be prevented or minimized and that the reclamation of mined lands will provide for the beneficial, sustainable long-term productive use of the mined and reclaimed lands for alternative land uses; and</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">2.   Production and conservation of minerals to be encouraged. <span class="p">The production and conservation of minerals will be encouraged while eliminating hazards to public health and safety and avoiding or minimizing adverse effects on the environment (e.g., air pollution, damage to biological resources, degradation of scenic quality, erosion, flooding, geologic subsidence, noise pollution, and water quality degradation), while giving proper consideration to community values relating to aesthetic enjoyment, range and forage, recreation, watershed, and wildlife.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">B.
