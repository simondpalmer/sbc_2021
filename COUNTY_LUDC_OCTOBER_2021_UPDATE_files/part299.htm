Purpose. <span class="p">The intent of the Flood Hazard development standards is to avoid exposing new development to flood hazards and to reduce the need for future flood control protective works and resulting alteration of stream and wetland environments by regulating development within the 100-year flood plain.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">B.   Development within floodway<span class="p">. All development, including construction, excavation, and grading, except for flood control projects and non-structural agricultural uses, shall be prohibited in the floodway, as determined by the County Public Works Department, unless off-setting improvements in accordance with Housing and Urban Development regulations are provided. If the proposed development falls within the floodway fringe, development may be permitted, providing creek setback requirements are met and finish floor elevations are above the projected 100-year flood elevation as specified in County Code Chapter 15A (Floodplain Management).</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">C.  Permitted development limitations. <span class="p">Permitted development shall not cause or contribute to flood hazards or lead to expenditure of public funds for flood control works, such as dams, stream channelizations, etc.</span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part298.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../COUNTY_LUDC_OCTOBER_2021_UPDATE.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part300.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
