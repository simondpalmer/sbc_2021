Transportation of processed oil.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">a.   Overland pipeline transport. <span class="p">Oil processed by facilities that receive oil from offshore fields exclusively or from both offshore and onshore fields shall be transported from the facility and the County to the final refining destination by overland pipeline, except in the case of highly viscous oil or during an emergency, as stipulated below. For the purposes of this Subsection, final refining destination shall mean a refinery in California where final refining of the subject oil into products is accomplished. In addition, oil shall be considered to reach its final refining destination if the oil has been:</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(1)  Transported out of the State of California, and does not reenter before final refining; or</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 144pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">(2)  Transferred to truck or train after leaving the County by pipeline and does not re-enter the County by truck or train, and is not transferred to a marine terminal vessel for further shipment to a port in California before final refining.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">b.  Other transportation methods. <span class="p">Transportation by a mode other than pipeline may be allowed only:</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(1)  For that fraction of the oil that cannot feasibly be transported by pipeline; and</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 144pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">(2)  When the environmental impacts of the alternative transportation mode are required to be mitigated to the maximum extent feasible.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In all cases, the burden of proof as to the infeasibility of transport by pipeline and the need for alternative transportation modes shall be on the shipper.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">c.   Highway or rail transport of highly viscous oil. <a href="part754.htm#bookmark341" class="s11">A Development Plan may allow transportation of highly viscous oil by highway or rail only if the Director finds that the oil is so highly viscous that pipeline transport is infeasible, taking into account available options (e.g., modifications to existing pipelines, blending of natural gas liquids). This finding shall be in addition to findings required for approval of Development Plans in Subsection </a><span class="s22">35.82.080</span><a href="part625.htm#bookmark248" class="s11">.E (Findings required for approval), </a><a href="part625.htm#bookmark248" class="a">Section 35.55.040 (Treatment and Processing Facilities - Findings for Development Plans)</a><a href="part625.htm#bookmark248" class="s11">.</a></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">d.   Emergency temporary transport by waterborne vessel. <span class="p">Temporary transport of oil by waterborne vessel may be authorized under an Emergency Permit if the Governor of the State of California declares a state of emergency in compliance with Public Resources Code Section 30262(a)(8) for an emergency that disrupts the pipeline transportation of oil produced offshore</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">of the County. In this case, the oil transported by waterborne vessel shall be limited to that fraction that cannot feasibly be transported by pipeline. Transport by waterborne vessel shall cease immediately when it becomes technically feasible to resume pipeline transport.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">11.  Additional standards if deemed necessary by Commission. <span class="p">In addition, the following development standards shall be applied to the extent deemed necessary by the Commission.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">a.   Visual compatibility. <span class="p">The installation shall be visually compatible with the existing and anticipated surroundings by use of any or all of the following measures where applicable: buffer strips; depressions, natural or artificial; screen planting and landscaping continually maintained, and camouflage and/or blending colors.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">b.   Monitoring system. <span class="p">A monitoring system to measure off-site impacts, including noise, vibration, odor, and air or water quality degradation, shall be required as a condition of approval.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">12.  Facility and site abandonment within the South Coast Consolidation Planning Area. <span class="p">The County shall review permits that are approved after August 12, 1985 for new or modified oil and gas facilities when throughput, averaged (arithmetic mean) over any 12 consecutive months, does not exceed three percent of the facilityâ€™s maximum permitted operating capacity. The review shall be conducted in a duly noticed public hearing to determine if facility abandonment or facility modifications are appropriate.</span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part602.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../COUNTY_LUDC_OCTOBER_2021_UPDATE.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part604.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
