Architectural projections and sign structures.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">1.   Architectural projections or sign structures shall not increase the number or area of allowed signs, nor shall they be used as a device that is, in itself, a sign, unless the sign is allowed under this Chapter.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">2.  Sign structures shall be free of unsightly supporting features (e.g., bracing, angle iron, guy wires, and cables).</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">B.  Height and setback requirements. <span class="p">Signs and sign structures shall meet the height and setback regulations of the specific zone in which they are located. Freestanding signs are structures for the purposes of the Development Code.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">C.  Measuring sign area. <span class="p">In applying the sign area standards of this Chapter, the periphery of the sign shall be established by drawing not more than eight straight lines encompassing the extremities of the sign within the smallest possible area. In the case of freestanding signs, the entire background area shall be included in the sign area measurements. In the case of a double-faced sign, only one face of the sign shall be included in the sign area measurement. Supporting structures so designed to perform an advertising function shall be included in the sign area. In the case of wall signs, the background area shall be included in the sign area measurements only if it is of a distinctive color, material, texture, or shape, the primary purpose of which is to enhance the advertising value of the sign, as determined by the Director.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">D.  Measuring sign height<span class="p">. The height of a sign is the vertical distance from the uppermost point used in measuring the area of a sign to the average grade immediately below the sign, including its base or the top of the nearest curb of the street on which the sign fronts, whichever measurement is the greatest.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">E.  Measuring street frontage<span class="p">. If the property abuts two or more streets, the length of the street frontage of the street carrying the greatest amount of traffic shall be used to determine if the property may be allowed</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to have freestanding sign unless the traffic is equal on two or more streets, in which case the length of the longest street frontage shall be used.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part394.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../COUNTY_LUDC_OCTOBER_2021_UPDATE.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part396.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
