Habitat Protection Plan</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">1.   The Applicant for a land use entitlement for a cannabis activity that would involve clearing of native vegetation or other sensitive vegetation in an area that has been identified as having a medium to high potential of being occupied by a special-status wildlife species, nesting bird, or a Federal or State- listed special-status plant species, shall prepare and submit a Habitat Protection Plan prepared by a Department-approved biologist, in coordination with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) as required for State or Federal permits and State or Federally listed species, designed to determine whether avoidance, minimization, or compensatory measures are necessary.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">2.   Focused species-specific surveys shall be required to determine whether a sensitive species or nesting bird may be present, and shall be conducted at the appropriate time of year and time of day when that species is active or otherwise identifiable. Where warranted by the findings of initial review, protocol level surveys may also be required.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">3.   If the project site is located within the known habitat of a species listed as rare, threatened, or endangered by the USFWS and/or CDFW, the issuance of a permit does not relieve the permit-holder of any duties, obligations, or responsibilities under the Endangered Species Act or any other law.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">4.  The Plan shall include:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: left;">a.   The location and extent of all driplines and sensitive root zones for all vegetation to be preserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">b.  The location of sensitive habitat with a detailed description of proposed disturbance.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">c.  Original and new locations for replanted species.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: left;">d.  Designated development envelopes. Include utility corridors, irrigation lines, roadways, driveways, etc.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: left;">e.   Equipment storage (including construction materials, equipment, fill soil, or rocks) and construction staging and parking areas.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">f.   Sensitive habitats, including but not limited to those listed below, shall be preserved.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(1)  Southern Vernal Pool</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(2)  Valley Needlegrass Grassland</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(3)  Southern California Coastal Lagoon</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(4)  Southern California Steelhead Stream</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(5)  Southern California Threespine Stickleback Stream</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(6)  Coastal and Valley Freshwater Marsh</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(7)  Northern and Southern Coastal Salt Marsh</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(8)  Central Coast Arroyo Willow Riparian Forest</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(9)  Southern Coast Live Oak Riparian Forest</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(10) Southern Cottonwood Willow Riparian Forest</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(11) Southern Willow Scrub</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(12) Central Maritime Chaparral</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">g.   During construction all sensitive habitat shall be temporarily fenced with chain-link or other material satisfactory to the Department, at least 200 feet from the edge of the sensitive habitat, and staked to prevent any collapse.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">h.  During construction and grading, all fencing, staking, and barriers shall be maintained.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">i.   During construction if it becomes necessary (as authorized by the Department) to disturb or remove any plants within the habitat area, a Department-approved biologist shall direct the work. Where feasible, specimens shall be boxed and replanted. If a Department-approved biologist certifies that it is not feasible to replant, plants shall be replaced under the direction of the Department-approved biologist at a 1:1 ratio. If replacement plants cannot all be accommodated on the same lot, a plan must be approved by the Department for replacement plants to be planted offsite.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">j.   During construction all grading activities shall be designed to ensure that habitat areas have proper drainage during and after construction, per a Department-approved biologist’s recommendations.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">k.   If any ground disturbances will occur during the nesting bird season (February – mid- September), prior to any ground disturbing activity, surveys for active nests shall be conducted by a Department-approved biologist following CDFW approved protocols, no more than 10 days prior to the start of activities. The surveys shall be conducted in a sufficient area around the work site to identify any nests that are present and to determine their status. Identified nests shall be continuously surveyed for the first 24 hours prior to any activities to establish a behavioral baseline. Once work commences, all nests shall be continuously monitored to detect</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">any behavioral changes. If behavioral changes are observed, the work causing that change shall cease and CDFW shall be consulted for additional avoidance and minimization measures. A minimum no disturbance buffer of 250 feet around active nests of non-listed bird species and a 500-foot no disturbance buffer around the nests of unlisted raptors shall be maintained until the breeding season has ended, or until the biologist determines that the birds have fledged and are no longer reliant upon the nest or parental care for survival. Any variance from these buffers shall be supported by the biologist and CDFW shall be notified in advance of implementation of a no disturbance buffer variance.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">l.   Applicants shall submit information about proposed pest management practices, including Integrated Pest Management techniques and proposed use, storage, and application of pesticides, herbicides, and/or rodenticides by type and amount as part of a Pest Management Plan to be reviewed and approved by the Department and the County Agricultural Commissioner (CAC) prior to issuance of a land use entitlement for the proposed cannabis activity. The Pest Management Plan shall describe the methods to be used for pest control, including the type, location, timing, and methods used for any rodenticide. If rodents are a pest issue for an applicant, non-toxic alternatives to rodenticides are recommended, such as mechanical controls like traps, gopher fencing, and weeding; biological controls such as natural pheromones; or cultural controls such as site maintenance and hygiene. Consistent with the California Department of Pesticide Regulation (DPR) determination that commercially grown cannabis is an agricultural commodity, cannabis cultivation on all licensed sites shall comply with the requirements of Division 6 and 7 of the Food and Agricultural Code and pertaining regulations. These laws and regulations set forth requirements for the legal use of pesticides, herbicides, and/or rodenticides, and are enforced by the CAC. Any uses of pesticide, herbicide, or rodenticide products shall be consistent with these requirements and any products on the site shall be placed, used, and stored in a manner that ensures that they will not enter or be released uncontrolled into the environment, including surface or ground waters. Per the California DPR’s established regulatory process, commercial cannabis cultivators planning on using pesticides, herbicides, and/or rodenticides shall obtain an Operator Identification Number from the CAC before they can purchase or use these chemicals. Within the Pest Management Plan, the applicant shall demonstrate sufficient knowledge of regulatory requirements regarding the safe and effective use of pesticides and/or rodenticides. Applicants that opt to use rodenticides shall provide an annual report of rodenticide use data to the CAC and County permitting.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">5.   Subsequent actions identified as necessary in the Habitat Protection Plan, such as species removal or relocation, shall be initiated following any required consultation with USFWS and CDFW pursuant to Federal and State regulations (respectively).</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">6.   The Applicant shall install all measures identified by the Habitat Protection Plan prior to commencement of cannabis activities or as otherwise specified in the Habitat Protection Plan. All necessary requirements identified in the Habitat Protection Plan such as buffers, species monitoring, and plant species replacement, shall be indicated on final plans.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">7.   The Applicant shall submit a Habitat Protection Plan to the Department and demonstrate that all requirements pertaining to the Habitat Protection Plan have been implemented and completed prior to issuance of permits or licenses for cannabis activities.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">8.   The Department shall dispatch on an ongoing basis a qualified inspector to monitor and ensure compliance with the Habitat Protection Plan.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part1031.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../COUNTY_LUDC_OCTOBER_2021_UPDATE.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1033.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
