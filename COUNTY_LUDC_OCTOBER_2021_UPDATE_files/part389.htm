Public purposes most directly expressed in the regulation of signs in the County are traffic safety as related to the diversion of a vehicle driver’s attention from the road and the economic and aesthetic welfare of the County as related to existing and future economic interests that depend in large measure upon the County’s ability to maintain its well-established reputation as an attractive area, both as to natural and man-made features, in which to visit and to live.</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part980.htm#bookmark447" class="s11">See “Signs” within </a>Article 35.11 (Glossary) <span style=" color: #000;">for definitions related to signage as used within this Chapter.</span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part388.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../COUNTY_LUDC_OCTOBER_2021_UPDATE.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part390.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
