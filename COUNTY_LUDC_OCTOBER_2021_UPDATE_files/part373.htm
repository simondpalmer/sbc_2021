Conjunctive use of parking facilities.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">a.   For the purpose of this Section, conjunctive use shall be defined as the joint use of parking spaces for two or more land uses where the hours of operation and demand for parking require that the parking spaces can be used by the individual uses at different times of the day or week, and can serve more than one use. The intent is to provide for possible reduction in the number of parking spaces ordinarily required for two or more land uses and the sharing of parking spaces under a set of unique circumstances, including the compatibility of the land uses, adjacent properties, and lack of need for separate parking facilities.</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part736.htm#bookmark339" class="s11">b.   A Conditional Use Permit shall be required for the joint use of parking spaces, in compliance with </a><a href="part736.htm#bookmark339" class="a">Section 35.82.060 (Conditional Use Permits and Minor Conditional Use </a>Permits)<span style=" color: #000;">. The Conditional Use Permit shall be subject to the following requirements:</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 145pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">(1)  The applicant shall demonstrate a need for parking spaces required for the individual uses according to the parking regulations in this Chapter. The applicant shall state the type of use proposed, time period of operation, and other necessary information to demonstrate that the joint use of parking spaces will not create traffic congestion or be detrimental to surrounding uses.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 144pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">(2)  In cases where the required number of parking spaces for individual uses differs, the parking requirement that is greater shall become effective.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 144pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">(3)  The applicant shall submit a title report for the lot proposed for conjunctive parking use and an agreement between the owners of record of the lot and prospective users. This agreement shall obligate the lot for conjunctive parking use, clearly define the obligation of each party to the agreement, and be recorded in the Santa Barbara County Recorderâ€™s Office. The Agreement shall provide that any modification to the terms of the Conjunctive Use Agreement shall be subject to Commission approval.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 144pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">(4)  Violation of the Conditional Use Permit shall be grounds for revocation of the joint parking use.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">3.   Off-street parking is prohibited in front of the building between the building and the street right-of- way line of a road having a roadway classification of P2 or 2 Lane Expressway on the circulation map for a Community Plan area.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part372.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../COUNTY_LUDC_OCTOBER_2021_UPDATE.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part374.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
