Mitigation of adverse impacts. <span class="p">Significant adverse impacts to the environment due to demolition and reclamation are mitigated to a level of insignificance or, where impacts cannot feasibly be mitigated to insignificance, they are mitigated to the maximum extent feasible.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">B.  Streets and highways. <span class="p">Where applicable, streets and highways are adequate and properly designed to carry the type and quantity of traffic generated by the proposed demolition and reclamation.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">C.  Conformance to requirements of other local, regional, or State entities. <span class="p">Any condition placed upon the operator or responsible party for assessment or remediation of soil or water contamination fully conforms to the permitting process and requirements of the Regional Water Quality Control Board and the County Fire Department.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">D.  Protection of health, safety, and welfare. <span class="p">The proposed reclamation will not be detrimental to the comfort, convenience, health, safety, and general welfare of the neighborhood, and will not be incompatible with the surrounding area.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">E.  Restoration to natural condition. <span class="p">The subject site will be restored to natural conditions unless any of the following conditions apply:</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">1.   Areas within the site are subject to approved development, in which case restoration and landscaping of these areas will conform to the newly permitted development. In cases where development is proposed but not yet permitted, restoration of affected areas to natural conditions may be waived; provided, the development is permitted within five years and the permittee has posted financial assurances acceptable to the Director to ensure restoration to natural conditions if the proposed development is not permitted.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">2.   Areas within the site are subject to agricultural uses that do not require a County permit, in which case the restoration will conform to conditions appropriate for agricultural uses.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">For purposes of this finding, the Director may allow abandonment in-place of specific improvements (e.g., emergency access roads or retaining walls) if the Director first finds that their removal will be detrimental to the health, safety, or general welfare of the public or the environment (e.g., undesired destabilization of slopes due to removal of a retaining wall, or eliminating a needed public evacuation route).</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">F.  Retention of improvements. <span class="p">Any retention of improvements to land is properly permitted in compliance with the County Code where permits are required.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">G.  Public access or use. <span class="p">The proposed reclamation will leave the subject site in a condition that is compatible with any existing easements or dedications for public access through, or public use of a portion of the property.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">H.  Completion of post-closure activities. <span class="p">The permit conditions contain specific enforceable requirements to ensure the timely closure of the host site and completion of post-closure activities.</span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part644.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../COUNTY_LUDC_OCTOBER_2021_UPDATE.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part646.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
