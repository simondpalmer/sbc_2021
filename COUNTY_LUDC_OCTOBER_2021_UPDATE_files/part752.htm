Additional findings required for Design Review applications within the Scenic Corridor - Mission Canyon (SC-MC) overlay zone.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">a.   New structures or alterations to existing structures will not impede views of, or interfere with the visual and historic character of the scenic corridor.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">b.   New structures or alterations to existing structures have been reviewed within the context of the traditional and historical architectural setting in the vicinity, including Mission Santa Barbara, the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History, “Glendessary House” (a County Landmark), and “Rockwood” (the Santa Barbara Woman’s Club). While no particular architectural style is prescribed for this area, project design should promote a smooth transition from the City of Santa Barbara’s “El Pueblo Viejo Landmark District” (around the Mission) to Mission Canyon. In this area, high quality construction and materials for exterior finishes are used.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">c.

New or altered fences, gates, gateposts, and walls are consistent with the architectural style of the structure, are compatible with the visual and historical character of the setting, are colored with appropriate earth tone colors to match adjacent soils or stone, are visually softened with appropriate landscaping, and make use of high quality construction and materials.</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s5">8.
