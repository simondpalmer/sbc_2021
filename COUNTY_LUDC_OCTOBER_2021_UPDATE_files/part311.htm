Corner lot. <span class="p">A corner lot shall have a front setback along each property line adjacent to a street.

Side setbacks. <span class="p">A required side setback shall be measured at right angles from the side property line, establishing a setback line parallel to the side property line which extends between the front and rear setbacks.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">a.   Side setback adjacent to alley. <span class="p">In computing the width of a side setback, if the setback abuts an alley, and the owner of the lot owns all or one-half of the underlying fee of the alley, up to one-half of the width of the alley may be included in the side yard.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">b.  Side setback variations in R-1/E-1 and R-2 zones. <span class="p">The required side setback for portions of a structure may be varied subject to all of the following limitations.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(1)  No portion of the structure shall be less than five feet from the side lines of the lot.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 144pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">(2)  No portion of an exterior wall of a structure containing non-fixed windows or doors opening into rooms of a structure (except a garage or other non-habitable space) shall be located closer to the side lines of a lot than the required side setback prior to any variation allowed by Subsection b.(3) below.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 144pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">(3)  A portion of a structure may be located within the required side setback provided that the footprint area of the portion of the structure that intrudes into the required side setback shall be compensated by an equal or greater area that is not covered by any footprint area located outside of and adjacent to the same side setback and the side setback line. The compensating area shall not be located farther from the adjacent side lot line than one- half of the lot width.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 144pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">(4)  The compensating area used to vary a side setback shall not be used to vary a rear setback on the same lot.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">c.   Through lot. <span class="p">On a through lot, the side setbacks shall extend the full depth of the lot between the front setbacks.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">3.   Rear setback. <span class="p">The rear setback shall be measured at right angles from the rear property line, establishing a setback line parallel to the rear property line.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">a.   Corner lot. <span class="p">The rear setback for a corner lot backing upon a key lot may be reduced to the size of the required side setback for the key lot or 10 feet, whichever is greater, provided that the total front, side, and rear setback area required by the applicable zone is not reduced. An accessory structure on a corner lot backing on a key lot shall be set back from the rear property line by a distance equal to the side setback requirements applicable to the key lot.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">b.   Rear setback adjacent to alley. <span class="p">In computing the depth of a rear setback, if the setback abuts an alley, and the owner of the lot owns all or one-half of the underlying fee of the alley, up to one-half of the width of the alley may be included in the rear setback.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">c.   Rear setback on triangular lot. <span class="p">Where a triangular lot has no rear lot line because its side lot lines converge to a point, an assumed line 10 feet long within the lot, parallel to and at the maximum possible distance from the front lot line, shall be deemed to be the rear lot line for the purpose of measuring the required rear setback. See Figure 3-6 (Triangular lot rear setback measurement).</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Figure 3-6 - Triangular lot rear setback measurement</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">d.  Rear setback variations in R-1/E-1, and R-2 zones. <span class="p">The required rear setback for portions of a structure may be varied subject to all of the following limitations.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 144pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">(1)  No portion of a structure used for dwelling purposes shall be closer than 15 feet to the rear line of the lot.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 144pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">(2)  A portion of a structure may be located within the required rear setback provided that the footprint area of the portion of the structure that intrudes into the required rear setback shall be compensated by an equal or greater area that is not covered by any footprint area located outside of and adjacent to the rear setback and the rear setback line.
