Accessory uses, including commercial uses, may be permitted provided they are determined to be customarily incidental to, secondary to, and supportive of the historical intent of the project. Typical accessory commercial uses may include a gift shop, caf√©, etc. Accessory commercial uses may occupy historical structures as long as the other standards in this Section are met. Typical occupying uses could include a restaurant, gift shop, antique shop, craft shops, florist, and other light commercial uses that the Commission finds are of similar character.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">b.

The Commission may grant a modification to this standard to permit one historical structure to be expanded by up to 40 percent of its gross floor area. Expansion based upon restoration to pre-existing size from present size shall not be defined as expansion under t6he percentage increases. All proposed modifications shall be subject to review by the Santa Barbara County Historical Landmark Advisory Committee and Design Review in compliance with </a><span class="s22">Section 35.82.070 (Design Review)</span><span class="p">.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">4.
