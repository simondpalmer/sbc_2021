Report required.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">a.   If the applicant contends that continued use of the property as a mobilehome park necessitates repairs and/or improvements that are not the result of the park owner or applicant’s negligence or failure to properly maintain the said property, and that the costs thereof makes continuation of the mobilehome park economically infeasible, then a report shall be made and submitted, under penalty of perjury, by a civil engineer or general contractor licensed as such in compliance with the laws of the State of California.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 144pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">1)   The report shall verify that such civil engineer or contractor has thoroughly inspected the entire mobilehome park and has determined that certain repairs and improvements must be made to the mobilehome park to maintain the mobilehome park in decent, safe and sanitary condition, and that those certain repairs are not the result of the mobilehome park owner or applicant’s negligent failure to properly maintain the said property.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 144pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">2)   The report shall describe the minimum period of time in which such improvements or repairs can be accomplished along with the estimated cost for the improvements and repairs.

If the proposed closure is due to conversion of the land to another use, an estimate of the value of the mobilehome park, if the park were permitted to be developed for the change of use proposed in the application for closure of the park, and an estimate of the value of said park, if use of the property as a mobilehome park is continued, are required. These estimates shall be prepared by a certified real estate appraiser who is acceptable to the County.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">5.
