Description.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">1.   The Transfer of Development Rights program is a market-driven program involving willing sellers and willing buyers. Landowners are not obligated to use the program but may participate voluntarily. The Transfer of Development Rights program allows eligible sending site (lots targeted for preservation) landowners to sever the development right(s), as defined in this Chapter, from rights associated with land ownership. Sending site landowners that choose to participate in the program are compensated at fair market value for the lost development potential through market sales of those development rights. Once the development rights are sold, the land is protected from future development in perpetuity through conservation easements. Sending site landowners are incentivized to participate since they can forego the lengthy and often costly development approval and building process yet receive payments commensurate with the realized profits of their property built to its highest and best use.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">2.   Eligible receiving sites (lots to accommodate development) in the unincorporated areas of the County may be developed at higher densities than otherwise allowed under current zoning with requisite purchases of “density credits.” So called receiving site developers are incentivized to participate since they are able to realize greater profits through enhanced entitlements.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">3.   Participating Entities that adopt plans and ordinances to allow for increased density on receiving sites may opt to participate in the County’s Transfer of Development Rights program through legally binding inter-jurisdictional agreements.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part683.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../COUNTY_LUDC_OCTOBER_2021_UPDATE.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part685.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
