For purposes of calculating a relocation payment, the rent differential shall not exceed the difference between the current space rent and the Fair Market Rent of a unit of a size appropriate to accommodate the displaced household as published annually by HUD. If the mobilehome owner sells their unit to a third party the mobilehome owner shall receive the proceeds from said sale and is also eligible for the aforementioned rent subsidy.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -26pt;text-align: justify;">3.
