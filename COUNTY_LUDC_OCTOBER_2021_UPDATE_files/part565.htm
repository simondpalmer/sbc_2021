Access/street addressing.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">a.   Access to the winery premises and access ways within the winery premises, shall be designed to the satisfaction of the County Traffic Engineer and County Fire Department and shall comply with the applicable County private road and driveway standards and requirements. Ingress and egress shall be clearly marked and visible, and turning movements into the winery premises shall not create congestion or unnecessary slowing at access points. Structure address numbers shall be posted at the driveway/access road winery premises entrances and on winery structures in compliance with County Fire Department requirements.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">b.   Existing roads shall be utilized to the maximum extent feasible in order to minimize grading, site disturbance, and the loss of agricultural land.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: left;">4.

In addition, the following design standards shall also apply.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">a.   Exterior. <span class="p">The design, scale, and character of the winery shall be compatible with existing development in the vicinity. Structures associated with the winery including production facilities shall have an exterior design style that is agricultural or residential in nature using earth tones and non-reflective paints, siding, and roofing materials. Structures shall not use an exterior design style typically associated with large industrial facilities.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">b.   Screening. <span class="p">The visibility of winery structures from public roads shall be minimized through the use of landscaping and other screening devices to ensure that the character of the area is retained. Tanks not located within a structure shall be completely screened from public roads.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">c.   Height. <span class="p">The height of a structure associated with a winery facility shall be limited to 35 feet.

Lighting. <span class="p">Exterior lighting fixtures shall be of a low intensity, low glare design and shall be shielded with full cutoff design and directed downward to ensure that neither the lamp nor the related reflector interior surface is visible from a location off of the winery premises in order to prevent spill over onto adjacent lots under separate ownership. Pole lighting fixtures shall be</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">used only for special events and seasonal agricultural activities. Exterior lighting shall not be installed or operated in a manner that would throw light, either reflected or directly, in an upward direction.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part564.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../COUNTY_LUDC_OCTOBER_2021_UPDATE.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part566.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
