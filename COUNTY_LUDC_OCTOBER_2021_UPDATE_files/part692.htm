Receiving site application process/determination of density bonus. <span class="p">The processing of applications for receiver site designation and award of density bonus shall be expedited to the maximum extent feasible. The following procedure shall be used to approve receiving sites and identify the density bonuses obtainable on eligible receiving sites through transferable development credit purchases.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">1.   Landowners seeking designation of their properties as eligible receiving sites must file an application with the Department. The application must include the lot(s) Assessor’s Parcel Number(s), current property ownership, preliminary title report not more than six months old, current zone designation and evidence supporting that the site meets the eligibility criteria.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">2.   The Department shall, within 30 days of the date an application is accepted as complete, notify the applicant if the site is an eligible receiving site based on the criteria of Subsection 35.64.050.A.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">3.   Sites that are determined to be eligible receiving sites shall require a pre-screen by the Commission, upon recommendation of the Director, to set: (a) the base density, and (b) the maximum allowable density obtainable on the site with transferable development credit purchases. The applicant must submit a preliminary draft conceptual plan and processing fee for the pre-screen analysis. The Director shall evaluate the application and report its findings to the Commission in the form of a recommendation as follows:</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part754.htm#bookmark341" class="s11">a.

The base density shall represent the number of dwelling units allowed on the property under its existing zone designation;</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">c.   The Director shall recommend an assignment of maximum density based upon neighborhood compatibility and existing surrounding land uses. This preliminary staff study shall serve as an initial assessment in an eventual environmental review in compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act to achieve final receiving site approval in compliance with Subsection B.4, below.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">d.   The Commission may accept, reject or modify the recommendation of the Director. The Commission’s determination of maximum density is not vested “by right” to the property; rather, it shall only represent a maximum number of additional units not be exceeded with transferable development credit purchases. The actual additional transferable development</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">credit density granted to the property shall be determined in compliance with Subsection B.4, below.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">e.   The action of the Commission to determine the maximum density is final subject to appeal in compliance with Chapter 35.102 (Appeals).</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">4.   Following the determination of density in compliance with Subsection 35.64.060.B.3, the applicant may submit a development application seeking a density less than or equal to the maximum density determined in compliance with Subsection 35.64.060.B.3. The application shall encompass all permits required for the project as specified in this Development Code and shall include, at a minimum, a Development Plan that provides details on the physical attributes of the project and environmental data necessary to conduct an initial study evaluation.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">a.   The matter shall be considered by the Commission at a noticed, public hearing with notice provided in the time and manner required in compliance with this Development Code. All permit applications associated with the proposed project, as well as the related environmental documents, shall be noticed and heard concurrently.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">b.   If and when the development application is approved or conditionally approved, the Department will calculate the transferable development credit density bonus which shall reflect the number of transferable development credits available to the project based on the difference between the previously determined base density and the project density as approved by the County. The following criteria shall apply in calculating the transferable development credits density bonus:</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 144pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">(1)  One transferable development credit shall equal one additional dwelling unit above base density;</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 144pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">(2)  The vested transferable development credit density bonus shall be an option in addition to State density bonus law for receiving site applicants to achieve greater density. Where a receiving site applicant has requested a density bonus under both State housing law and this Transfer of Development Rights program, and such request exceeds the maximum allowable density obtainable on the site with transferable development credit purchases, State density bonus awards must be made before determining whether transferable development credits can be granted under this Transfer of Development Rights program.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">c.   Affordable units required under the Inclusionary Housing Policy of the County’s Housing Element shall only apply to the base density of the receiving site that is determined in compliance with Subsection 35.64.050.B.3.b.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">5.   Within the 30 calendar days following the County’s final action on the project, the Department shall issue to the receiving site applicant transferable development credit certificates for each of the additional dwelling units, obtainable through transferable development credit purchase, that are granted by the Commission. The issuance of transferable development credits by the County to projects that may be appealed to the Coastal Commission may also be appealed to the Coastal Commission. If the project and/or the issuance transferable development credits is appealed to the Coastal Commission, the County shall not issue the transferable development credit certificates until the Coastal Commission takes final action.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">6.   The receiving site applicant shall be allowed to purchase, only from the TDR Authority, a commensurate number of transferable development credits that are granted by the Commission for each receiving site.</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part694.htm#bookmark313" class="s11">7.   The Department shall only grant authority to construct (e.g., Land Use Permit, or Zoning Clearance, and Building Permits) to a receiving site applicant for a project with additional units that have certificates possessing official TDR Authority approval as indicated in Subsection </a>35.64.090<span style=" color: #000;">.E. The TDR Authority approval shall be evidence to in-whole payment(s) by the receiving site applicant for the transferable development credit(s).</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part691.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../COUNTY_LUDC_OCTOBER_2021_UPDATE.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part693.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
