Development standards.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: left;">1.  Standards applicable to pipeline operations. <span class="p">The following standards shall apply to pipeline projects:</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">a.   Zone regulations not applicable. <a href="part97.htm#bookmark14" class="s11">The regulations in </a><a href="part97.htm#bookmark14" class="a">Article 35.2 (Zones and Allowable Land Uses)</a><span class="p">, for the applicable zones in which oil and gas pipelines are allowed, shall not apply to the oil and gas pipelines. See Table 5-1 (Allowed Uses and Permit/Plan Requirements for Oil and Gas Facilities Area) above.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">b.   Delivery hours. <span class="p">Except in an emergency, materials, equipment, tools, or pipes shall not be delivered to or removed from a pipeline construction site through streets within a residential zone between the hours of 9 p.m. and 7 a.m. of the next day.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">c.   Post-installation requirements. <span class="p">After completion of back filling and compacting of the pipeline ditch, the site shall be returned to grade where practical and the excess soil shall be removed to an appropriate disposal site.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">d.  Drainage. <span class="p">During construction of the pipeline, there shall not be permanent blocking of surface drainages.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">e.   Location of pipeline corridor. <span class="p">A pipeline corridor shall be sited so as to avoid significant impacts to resources (e.g., aquatic habitats, and archaeological areas) to the maximum extent feasible.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">f.   Spills. <span class="p">Where pipeline segments carrying hydrocarbon liquids pass through sensitive resource areas (e.g., aquatic habitats) as identified by the project environmental review, provisions identified in the environmental review shall be applied to minimize the amount of liquids released in the sensitive areas in the event of a spill. The potential for damage in those areas shall be minimized by considering spill volumes, duration, and trajectories in the selection of a pipeline corridor. In addition, appropriate measures for spill containment and cleanup (e.g., catch basins to contain a spill) shall be included as part of the required emergency response plan.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">g.   Burial within corridor. <span class="p">Permits for new pipeline construction shall require engineering of pipe placement and burial within a corridor to minimize incremental widening of the corridor during subsequent pipeline projects, unless the proposed route is determined to be unacceptable for additional pipelines.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">2.   Additional development standards as deemed necessary by Commission. <span class="p">In addition, the following standards may be applied to the extent deemed necessary by the Commission:</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">a.   Performance security. <span class="p">A performance security shall be provided in an amount sufficient to ensure completion of requirements of the approved revegetation and restoration plan and shall be released upon satisfactory completion.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">b.   Inspection of disturbed areas. <span class="p">Disturbed areas shall be jointly inspected by the applicant and staff 12 months after completion of construction to assess the effectiveness of the revegetation and restoration program. This inspection shall continue on an annual basis to monitor progress in returning the site to pre-construction conditions or until additional monitoring is not deemed necessary by the Department. Inspection results shall be submitted annually to the Department, and additional treatment of the site shall be applied as deemed necessary by the Department.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">c.   Visual compatibility. <span class="p">Above-ground sections of the pipeline and related facilities, excepting those installed on a temporary basis for a testing period not to exceed 12 months, shall be visually compatible with the present and anticipated surroundings by use of any or all of the following measures where applicable: buffer strips; depressions, natural or artificial; screen planting and landscaping continually maintained; and camouflage and/or blending colors.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">d.   Noise. <span class="p">Proposed facilities shall be designed and housed so that the noise generated by the facilities as measured at the property boundaries shall be equal to or below the existing noise level of the surrounding area except under temporary testing or emergency situations. Measures to reduce adverse impacts (e.g., due to noise, vibration) to the maximum extent feasible shall be used for facilities located adjacent to noise sensitive locations as identified in the Comprehensive Plan.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 155pt;text-indent: -118pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark234">C</a><span class="s20">HAPTER </span>35.53 - P<span class="s20">ERMIT </span>R<span class="s20">EQUIREMENTS AND </span>P<span class="s20">LAN </span>A<span class="s20">PPLICATIONS</span>, P<span class="s20">ROCESSING</span>, <span class="s20">AND </span>R<span class="s20">EVIEW</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part606.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../COUNTY_LUDC_OCTOBER_2021_UPDATE.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part608.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
