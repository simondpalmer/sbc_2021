All roads, driveways and parking areas (private as well as public) shall be sited so as to avoid, where feasible, their visibility from public viewing areas (e.g., public roads, trails and the ocean) including, where possible, the consolidation and sharing of common access.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -26pt;text-align: justify;">b.   If paved surfaces cannot feasibly be located outside the public viewshed due to geologic, topographic or biological constraints, only surface materials that are designed to be compatible and not detract from the rural character of the Gaviota Coast shall be allowed.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -26pt;text-align: justify;">c.
