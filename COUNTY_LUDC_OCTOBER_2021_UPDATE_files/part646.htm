Contamination and spills. <span class="p">All equipment shall be cleaned of oil or other contaminants before dismantlement in order to reduce any risk of contamination of soils or water during demolition of the facility to the maximum extent feasible.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">1.  Where applicable, the permittee shall prepare and submit a Spill Contingency Plan to the County Fire Department.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">2.   The plan shall identify measures to prevent and contain spills during dismantling and removal of facilities, as well as how spills will be cleaned up once they have occurred.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">B.  Other permits. <span class="p">The permittee shall obtain all other necessary permits from other agencies and, where applicable, submit proof of permits issued by the California Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources to plug and abandon wells or to inject waste water for purposes of disposal into any State oil and gas field before issuance of the Demolition and Reclamation Permit.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">C.  Monitoring to ensure compliance and provide recommendations. <span class="p">The demolition and reclamation shall be adequately monitored by a qualified individual, funded by the permittee and retained by the County, to ensure compliance with those conditions designed to mitigate anticipated significant adverse effects on the environment and to provide recommendations in instances where effects were not anticipated or mitigated by the conditions imposed on the Demolition and Reclamation Permit. Pre-reclamation and post- reclamation surveys of sensitive resources shall be employed as appropriate to measure compliance.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">D.  Topsoil. <span class="p">Topsoil shall be stockpiled, covered, and saved for use as topsoil when excavated areas are back- filled unless the soil is treated onsite or removed for off-site disposal due to contamination.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">E.  Truck traffic. <span class="p">If appropriate, truck traffic transporting materials to and from the subject site shall avoid arriving or departing the site during the peak traffic hours of 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. to 6:00</span></p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">p.m. weekdays (or other peak-hour periods applicable to the location of the traffic).</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">F.  Sight distance and access. <span class="p">Adequacy of sight distance, ingress/egress, and emergency access shall be verified by the County Public Works and Fire Departments.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">G.  Dust. <span class="p">Measures shall be implemented to inhibit dust generation, where appropriate. Unavoidable generation of dust shall be kept to a minimum through effective controls.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">H.  Recycling. <span class="p">The permittee shall implement a viable recycling plan that meets County approval and includes provisions to maximize recycling of asphalt, concrete, and equipment, and to minimize disposal of wastes into hazardous waste and solid waste management facilities to the maximum extent feasible.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">I.   Contouring. <span class="p">Contouring of the land shall be compatible with the surrounding natural topography, unless otherwise approved to accommodate another permitted use or required drainage.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">J.  Erosion control. <span class="p">The permittee shall implement appropriate measures to control erosion both during and after site closure.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">K.  Revegetation. <span class="p">Establishment of vegetation shall be in compliance with an approved revegetation plan and the following standards:</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">1.   In compliance with the Countyâ€™s Fire Plan, as implemented by the County Fire Department, all disturbed areas identified for vegetation shall be disked or ripped to an appropriate depth to eliminate</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">compaction and establish a suitable root zone in preparation for planting, except where the requirement poses a significant adverse environmental impact.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">2.   Native seeds and plants shall be used when returning the area to natural conditions. The Director shall define an acceptable geographic area from which genetically compatible, native-seed stocks may be selected for site restoration in order to protect the genetic integrity and the habitat value of the site and its surrounding area. Other seeds (e.g., pasture mix) shall be permitted in areas designated for the use.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">L.  Subsurface pipeline segments. <span class="p">Subsurface segments of inter-facility pipelines may be abandoned in-place, except under the following circumstances:</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">1.  Presence of the pipeline would inhibit future land uses.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 86pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: justify;">2.  Modeling approved by the United States Army Corp. of Engineers or United States Bureau of Reclamation indicates that segments of the pipeline in erosive locations would become exposed at some time during the next 100 years, and environmental review determines that impacts from exposure and subsequent removal during inclement weather are more significant than removal at the time of abandonment.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">M.  Recorded notice or abandoned pipeline. <span class="p">The permittee shall ensure that appropriate notification has been recorded with the County Clerk-Recorder to update, supersede, or release the recorded rights-of-way where a subsurface pipeline is abandoned in-place. This notice shall describe the presence and location of the abandoned pipeline, any material placed in the pipeline for abandonment, and the operator and owner of the pipeline before abandonment.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">N.  Previously unidentified contamination. <span class="p">The site shall be assessed for previously unidentified contamination.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">1.  The permittee shall ensure that any discovery of contamination shall be reported to the Director and the County Fire Department.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">2.   The permittee shall diligently seek all necessary permit approvals, including revisions to the Demolition and Reclamation Permit, if any are required, in order to remediate the contamination.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">O.  Other conditions or requirements. <span class="p">The Director in consultation with other County agencies, may impose any other appropriate, necessary and reasonable conditions or require any changes to the project as deemed necessary to protect the health, safety and general welfare of the public, protect property, preserve the character, natural resources, or scenic quality of the area, or implement the purpose of this Section or any other provisions of the County Code.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">P.  Independent business function. <span class="p">In the case of an independent business function of a permitted land use, the Director shall have discretion to determine the timing and extent of the requirements of the Demolition and Reclamation Permit. Factors that the Director may consider shall include:</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">1.   Whether removal of the independent business function would substantially reduce the overall footprint of the permitted land use, reduce any significant visual impact, or reduce any significant risk to public safety.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">2.   Whether site restoration is feasible at the time the independent business function is removed, compared to deferring site restoration to a time that the entire permitted land use is removed.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">Q.  Recorded notice of contamination left in place. <span class="p">The permittee shall ensure that appropriate notification has been recorded with the County Clerk-Recorder to describe the presence and location of any contamination left in place under the authority of the County Fire Department.</span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part645.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../COUNTY_LUDC_OCTOBER_2021_UPDATE.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part647.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
