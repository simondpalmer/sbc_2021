Sites determined by the Department to be appropriate as collocated facilities or sites shall be designed in a way that antenna support structures and other associated features (e.g. parking areas, access roads, utilities, equipment buildings) may be shared by site users. Criteria used to determine suitability for collocation include the visibility of the existing site, potential for exacerbating the visual impact of the existing site, availability of necessary utilities (power and telephone), existing vegetative screening, availability of more visually suitable sites that meet the radiofrequency needs in the surrounding area, and cumulative radiofrequency emission studies showing compliance with radiofrequency standards established by the FCC.

A facility shall not be installed on an exposed ridgeline unless it blends with the surrounding existing natural or manmade environment in a manner that ensures that it will not be substantially visible from public viewing areas (e.g., public road, trails, recreation areas) or is collocated in a multiple user facility.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">c.   A facility that is substantially visible from a public viewing area shall not be installed closer than two miles from another substantially visible facility unless it is an existing collocated facility situated on a multiple user site.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">d.   Telecommunication facilities that are substantially visible from public viewing areas shall be sited below the ridgeline, depressed or located behind earth berms in order to minimize their profile and minimize any intrusion into the skyline. In addition, where feasible, and where visual impacts would be reduced, the facility shall be designed to look like the natural or manmade environment (e.g., designed to look like a tree, rock outcropping, or streetlight) or designed to integrate into the natural environment (e.g., imbedded in a hillside). These facilities shall be compatible with the existing surrounding environment.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part575.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../COUNTY_LUDC_OCTOBER_2021_UPDATE.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part577.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
