Consolidation or collocation on or adjacent to an existing processing facility to accommodate the proposed production is not feasible or is more environmentally damaging.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">2.   There are not feasible alternative locations for the proposed processing facility that are less environmentally damaging.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">3.   The proposed facility is compatible with the present and allowed recreational and residential development and the scenic resources of the surrounding area.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">4.   Gas processing facilities proposed in the North County Consolidation Planning Area (NCCPA), including expansion of existing facilities, have been sited in compliance with criteria in the Comprehensive Plan study entitled, Siting Gas Processing Facilities. Additionally, sites are selected with adequate consideration of future gas processing needs in the NCCPA to optimize siting and consolidation strategies. The &quot;expansion&quot; of an existing facility shall mean structural modifications, alterations, expansions, or enlargements that result in increased facility capacity, or changes in facility use, operation, or other limitations imposed by permit or other law. The &quot;expansion&quot; of an existing facility shall also mean introduction of production from a field not served by the processing facility since January 1, 1986, or from a new production well that increases the current area extent of a field presently served by the facility. Expansion shall not include modification to existing facilities that is required to comply with current health and safety regulations, and codes.</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s5">B.

Existing and approved processing capacity at the County designated consolidation sites is insufficient to accommodate proposed new production for a period of time that would render development of the proposed offshore reservoir infeasible. This finding shall take into account feasible delays in development of the offshore reservoir to maximize use of existing and approved processing capacity, and feasible expansion of existing processing facilities to provide sufficient capacity.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">2.   The specific properties of oil or gas from a particular reservoir considering available information on the physical and chemical characteristics of the stock, including but not limited to API gravity, sulfur and water content, viscosity, and pour point would render development of the resource technically infeasible unless specialized units can be built. This finding shall consider partial dehydration as a specialized unit if it is required to adapt a resource to the technical requirements of a processing facility. Modifications or additions to existing facilities shall be favored over construction of redundant processing capacity as long as the modifications or additions render the resource characteristics and the technical processing requirements of a facility compatible with one another.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">3.  Commingling the production in existing or already approved facilities at designated consolidation sites is environmentally unacceptable.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Additionally, Preliminary or Final Development Plan for expansion or construction of processing facilities shall not be approved unless the review authority also makes all of the following findings to restrict industrialization of the area.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">4.  The expansion of existing facilities or construction of new facilities are to be located at a consolidated oil and gas processing site as designated in the Comprehensive Plan.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">5.   The proposed processing facilities shall use, to the maximum extent feasible, existing ancillary facilities at the consolidated site.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part624.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../COUNTY_LUDC_OCTOBER_2021_UPDATE.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part626.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
