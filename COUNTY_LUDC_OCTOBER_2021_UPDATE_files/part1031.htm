Tree Protection Plan.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">1.   The Applicant for a land use entitlement for a commercial cannabis activity that would involve pruning, damage, or removal of a native tree, shall prepare and submit to the Department a Tree Protection Plan prepared by a Department-approved arborist designed to determine whether avoidance, minimization, or compensatory measures are necessary.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">2.  The Plan shall include:</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: left;">a.   Biologically favorable options for access roads, utilities, drainages, and structure placement, taking into account native tree and shrub species, age, and health with preservation emphasized.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: left;">b.  Designated development envelopes. Include utility corridors, irrigation lines, roadways, driveways, etc.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: left;">c.   Equipment storage (including construction materials, equipment, fill soil, or rocks) and construction staging and parking areas outside of the protection area.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: left;">d.   The type and location of protective fencing or other barriers to be in place to protect trees in protection areas during construction.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: left;">e.   The location of all tree wells or retaining walls. These shall be located outside the area within six feet of the dripline of all protected trees unless authorized by the County.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: left;">f.   The location of all paths within 25 feet of dripline areas. Only pervious paving materials are permitted within 6 feet of dripline areas.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">g.  The location of any replacement trees.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3.  During construction these standards shall be met:</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">a.   All trees shall be protected by a fence located at least 6 feet outside of the dripline. Fencing shall be at least 3 feet high, staked to prevent any collapse, and with signs identifying the protection area placed in 15-foot intervals on the fencing.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">b.  All grading and construction fencing, staking, and signage shall be maintained.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">c.  All trees located within 25 feet of buildings shall be protected from stucco and/or paint.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">d.  No irrigation is permitted within 6 feet of the dripline of any protected tree unless specifically authorized.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">e.   If the use of hand tools is deemed infeasible by the Director, work with rubber-tired construction equipment weighing 5 tons or less may be authorized by the Director. If significant large rocks are present, or if soil placement will impact surrounding trees, then a small tracked excavator may be used as determined by the Department-approved biologist.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">f.   A Department-approved arborist shall direct and oversee any development activity required within the dripline or sensitive root zone of any specimen tree. Any roots of one inch in diameter or greater which are encountered during grading or construction, and/or tree removal or trimming, must be cleanly cut.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">g.  Grading shall be designed to avoid ponding and ensure proper drainage within driplines of oak trees.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">h.   The Applicant shall designate a Department-approved arborist to be onsite throughout all grading and construction activities which may impact native trees. Duties of the arborist include the responsibility to ensure all aspects of the approved Tree Protection Plan are carried out.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">4.  Replacement trees shall be installed in compliance with the following standards:</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: left;">a.   The replacement trees must be a native species, planted at a 10:1 ratio for oak trees (15:1 for Blue or Valley Oaks), and a 2:1 ratio for other trees.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">b.  The replacement trees must be species from locally obtained plants and seed stock.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">c.  The replacement trees must be gopher-fenced.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">d.  The replacement trees must be irrigated with drip irrigation on a timer until established.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">e.  The replacement trees must be weaned off of irrigation over a period of 2 to 3 years.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">f.  No replacement tree shall require permanent irrigation within the dripline of the tree.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">g.  If replacement trees cannot all be accommodated on the same lot, the Applicant shall submit a plan for replacement trees to be planted offsite.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">h.   The replacement trees must be protected from predation by wild and domestic animals and from human interference by the use of staked, chain link fencing and gopher fencing during the maintenance period.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">5.   The Applicant shall install all measures identified by the Tree Protection Plan onsite prior to commencement of cannabis activities, as applicable. All such measures shall be indicated on final plans.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">6.   Prior to issuance of the cannabis permit, the Applicant shall submit the Tree Protection Plan to the Department for review and approval. The Applicant shall implement all tree protection measures of the Tree Protection Plan pursuant to the specific timing requirement for each measure set forth in the Tree Protection Plan.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">7.   The Department shall dispatch, on an ongoing basis, a qualified inspector to monitor and ensure compliance with the Tree Protection Plan.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part1030.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../COUNTY_LUDC_OCTOBER_2021_UPDATE.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1032.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
