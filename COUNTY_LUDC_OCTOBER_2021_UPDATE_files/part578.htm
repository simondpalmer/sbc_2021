The Permittee shall remove all support structures, antennas, equipment and associated improvements and restore the site to its natural pre-construction state within one year of discontinuing use of the facility or upon permit revocation.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">b.  Should the Permittee require more than one year to complete removal and restoration activities the Permittee shall apply for a one-time time extension.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">c.   In the event the Owner requests that the facility or structures remain, the Owner shall apply for necessary permits for those structures within one year of discontinued use.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">d.

Color compatibility. <span class="p">Prior to the issuance of a Zoning Clearance or Land Use Permit, the applicant shall erect an onsite demonstration structure of sufficient scale and height to allow the Director to determine that the proposed exterior color is aesthetically compatible with the surrounding area. If the applicant elects not to erect this demonstration structure prior to issuance of the Zoning Clearance or the Land Use Permit, the Director may determine within 30 days of the facility becoming operational that the exterior color is not aesthetically compatible with the surrounding area and require that the exterior color be changed.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">F.  Public notice. <a href="part945.htm#bookmark424" class="s11">Notice of the approval of any Land Use Permit, or the pending decision of the Director on a Development Plan, or a public hearing on a Conditional Use Permit or Development Plan shall be given in compliance with </a><a href="part945.htm#bookmark424" class="a">Chapter 35.106 (Noticing and Public Hearings)</a><a href="part945.htm#bookmark424" class="s11">.</a></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">G.

The support structure and antenna do not intrude into the skyline as seen from a County-designated scenic highway.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: left;">2.   The support structure and antenna exceed 100 feet only when technical requirements dictate (e.g. FCC signal strength and required coverage).</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: left;">3.   The height of the support structure and antenna are reduced to the maximum extent feasible, taking into account the use for which the antenna is proposed.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: left;">4.
