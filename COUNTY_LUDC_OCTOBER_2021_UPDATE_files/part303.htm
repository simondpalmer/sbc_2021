Minimum lot area.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">a.   Minimum lot area. <span class="p">No lot involved in the Lot Line Adjustment whose area is equal to or greater than the minimum lot area requirement of the applicable zone shall become smaller than the minimum lot area requirement of the applicable zone as a result of the Lot Line Adjustment.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">3.   Except as provided in this Section, all lots resulting from the Lot Line Adjustment shall comply with the minimum lot area requirements of the applicable zone. A Lot Line Adjustment may be approved</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">that results in one or more lots that are smaller than the minimum lot area requirement of the applicable zone provided that it complies with all of the following requirements.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">a.  The Lot Line Adjustment shall not result in increased subdivision potential for any lot involved in the lot line adjustment.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">b.   The Lot Line Adjustment will not result in a greater number of residential developable lots than existed prior to the adjustment. For the purposes of this Subsection B.3 only, a lot shall not be deemed residentially developable if the documents reflecting its approval and/or creation identify that, 1) the lot is not a building site, or 2) the lot is designated for a non-residential purpose including well sites, reservoirs and roads. A lot shall be deemed residentially developable for the purposes of this Subsection B.3 if it has an existing one-family dwelling constructed in compliance with a valid County permit, or existing and proposed lots comply with all of the following criteria.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 144pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">(1)  Water supply. <span class="p">The lot shall have adequate water resources to serve the estimated interior and exterior needs for residential development as follows: 1) a letter of service from the appropriate district or mutual water company shall document that adequate water service is available to the lot and that the service complies with the company&#39;s Domestic Water Supply Permit, or 2) a Public Health Department or State approved water system.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 144pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">(2)  Sewage disposal. <span class="p">The lot is served by a public sewer system and a letter of available service can be obtained from the appropriate district. A lot to be served by an onsite wastewater treatment system shall meet all applicable County requirements for permitting and installation, including percolation tests, as determined by the Public Health Department.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 144pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">(3)  Access. <span class="p">The lot is currently served by an existing private road meeting applicable fire agency roadway standards that connects to a public road or right-of-way easement, or can establish legal access to a public road or right-of-way easement meeting applicable fire agency roadway standards.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 144pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">(4)  Slope stability. <span class="p">Development of the lot including infrastructure avoids slopes of 30 percent and greater.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 144pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">(5)  Agriculture viability. <span class="p">Development of the lot shall not threaten or impair agricultural viability on productive agriculture lands within or adjacent to the lot.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 144pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">(6)  Environmentally sensitive habitat. <span class="p">Development of the lot avoids or minimizes impacts where appropriate to environmentally sensitive habitat and buffer areas, and riparian corridor and buffer areas.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 144pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">(7)  Hazards. <span class="p">Development of the lot shall not result in a hazard to life and property. Potential hazards include, flood, geologic and fire.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 144pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">(8)  Consistency with Comprehensive Plan and Development Code. <span class="p">Development of the lot is consistent with the setback, lot coverage and parking requirements of the Development Code and consistent with the Comprehensive Plan and the public health, safety and welfare of the community.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">To provide notification to existing and subsequent property owners when a finding is made that a lot is deemed not to be residentially developable, a statement of this finding shall be recorded concurrently with the deed of the lot, in compliance with County Code Section 21-92 (Procedures).</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">4.   The Lot Line Adjustment will not increase any violation of lot width, setback, lot coverage, parking or other similar requirement of the applicable zone, or make an existing violation more onerous.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">5.   The affected lots are in compliance with all laws, rules and regulations pertaining to zoning uses, setbacks and any other applicable provisions of this Development Code, or the Lot Line Adjustment has been conditioned to require compliance with these rules and regulations, and any zoning violation fees imposed in compliance with applicable law have been paid. This finding shall not be interpreted to impose new requirements on legal nonconforming uses and structures under the requirements of <span style=" color: #00F;">Chapter 35.101 (Nonconforming Uses, Structures, and Lots)</span>.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">6.   Conditions have been imposed to facilitate the relocation of existing utilities, infrastructure and easements.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">C.  Additional required findings for Lot Line Adjustments within an agricultural preserve. <span class="p">In addition to the findings required under Subsection B. (Required findings for approval) above, the approval of a Lot Line Adjustment proposed on agriculturally zoned lots that are subject to an Agricultural Preserve Contract in compliance with the County Uniform Rules for Agricultural Preserves and Farmland Security Zones shall require that the review authority also make the following findings:</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">1.   The new contract or contracts will enforceably restrict the adjusted boundaries of the lot for an initial term for at least as long as the unexpired term of the rescinded contract or contracts, but for not less than 10 years.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">2.   There is no net decrease in the amount of the acreage restricted. In cases where two lots involved in a lot line adjustment are both subject to contracts rescinded pursuant to this section, this finding will be satisfied if the aggregate acreage of the land restricted by the new contracts is at least as great as the aggregate acreage restricted by the rescinded contracts.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">3.  At least 90 percent of the land under the former contract or contracts remains under the new contract or contracts.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">4.  After the lot line adjustment, the parcels of land subject to contract will be large enough to sustain their agricultural use.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">5.   The lot line adjustment would not compromise the long-term agricultural productivity of the lot or other agricultural lands subject to a contract or contracts.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">6.  The lot line adjustment is not likely to result in the removal of adjacent land from agricultural use.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">7.   The lot line adjustment does not result in a greater number of developable lots than existed prior to the adjustment, or an adjusted lot that is inconsistent with the Comprehensive Plan.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part302.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../COUNTY_LUDC_OCTOBER_2021_UPDATE.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part304.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
