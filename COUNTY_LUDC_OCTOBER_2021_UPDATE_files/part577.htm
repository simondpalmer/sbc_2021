Demonstration  of  compliance.  <span class="p">Compliance  with  all  applicable  standards  shall  be demonstrated with a report prepared by a qualified professional acceptable to the County to perform radio frequency (RF) field testing to evaluate compliance with current federally established MPE standards. Compliance shall be demonstrated as needed to address changes in setting, technology and FCC regulations.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">b.   Conditions of approval. <span class="p">The approved planning permit for the facility may include conditions of approval as determined to be appropriate by the review authority to ensure that the facility is operated in a manner that does not pose, either by itself or in combination with other facilities, a potential threat to public safety. Said conditions of approval may include the following requirements:</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 144pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">(1)  Initial verification. <span class="p">The Permittee shall submit a report prepared by a qualified professional acceptable to the County (wholly independent of Permittee) that includes a RF field test that measures actual RF electromagnetic exposure at the site within 30 days of Final Building Permit Clearance.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 171pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">(a)  This RF field-testing shall measure all ambient sources of RF energy at the site and report the cumulative RF exposure, including contributions from the site together with other sources of RF energy in the environment as a whole,</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 171pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">(b)  The field test should include the author&#39;s/professional’s findings with respect to compliance with federally established MPE standards.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 171pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">(c)  Should the facility exceed the applicable standards, the facility shall cease and desist commercial operations until it complies with, or has been modified to comply with, applicable RF standards.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 151pt;text-indent: -28pt;text-align: justify;">(2)  Continued compliance. <span class="p">The Permittee shall demonstrate continued compliance with the MPE limits through submittal of regular RF field test reporting in compliance with the following.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 180pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">(a)  Every five years, or other time period as specified by the review authority as a condition of approval of the project, a report prepared by a qualified professional acceptable to the County to perform RF field testing to evaluate compliance with current federally established MPE standards shall be prepared that lists the actual measured level of RF emissions radiating from the whole facility. The report shall be submitted by the newest carrier operating at the facility to the Director. If the level of RF emissions has changed since permit approval, measurements of RF levels in nearby inhabited areas shall be taken and submitted with the report.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 144pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">(3)  Facility upgrades. <span class="p">Prior to the addition/replacement of equipment which has the potential to increase RF emissions at any public location beyond that estimated in the initial application and is within the scope of the project description, Permittee shall submit a report providing the calculation of predicted maximum effective radiated power including the new equipment as well as the maximum cumulative potential public RF exposure expressed as a percentage of the public MPE limit attributable to the site as a whole. Once the new equipment has been installed, Permittee shall perform Initial Verification as stated above.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 144pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">(4)  Updated standards. <span class="p">In the event the federally established RF public exposure standards change, the Permittee shall submit a report with calculations of the maximum potential public RF exposure from the Project with respect to the revised RF public exposure standards within 90 days of the date the change becomes effective. If calculated levels exceed 80 percent of the applicable RF standards, Permittee shall notify the County and submit a MPE compliance verification report with the results from current RF field- testing at the site.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">c.   Failure to supply reports. <a href="part916.htm#bookmark408" class="s11">Failure to supply the reports required in compliance with this Subsection E.1 within 30 days following the date that written notice is mailed by the Director that such compliance report is due or failure to remain in continued compliance with the MPE limit shall be grounds for revocation of the Land Use Permit or other entitlement of use by the Director. The decision of the Director to revoke the Land Use Permit or other entitlement of use is final subject to appeal in compliance with </a><span class="s22">Chapter 35.102 (Appeals)</span><span class="p">.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">2.   Project Review. <span class="p">The County reserves the right to undertake inspection of the facility and require the Permittee to modify its facilities should a more effective means of ensuring aesthetic compatibility with surrounding uses have become available as a result of subsequent technological advances, changes in circumstance from the time the project was initially approved, or the project fails to achieve the intended purposes of the development standards listed in Subsection D. (Additional development standards for telecommunication facilities).</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">3.
