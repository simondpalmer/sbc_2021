Whenever 25 percent or more of the total number of mobilehome sites within a mobilehome park that are occupied as of April 12, 2012 are uninhabited for more than 90 consecutive days, and such condition was not caused by a natural or physical disaster beyond the control of the mobilehome park owner, then such condition shall be deemed a “mobilehome park closure” for the purposes of this ordinance. The mobilehome park owner shall file an application for the mobilehome park closure, in compliance with the requirements of this Section. A mobilehome site is considered to be “uninhabited” when no rent is being paid for use of the site and for a period of 90 days or more it is either (i) unoccupied by a mobilehome, or (ii) occupied by a mobilehome in which no person resides.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">B.   Whenever a mobilehome park resident or other interested person has reason to believe that 25 percent or more of the total number of mobilehome sites within a mobilehome park are uninhabited, as described in Subsection A, above, such resident or person may file a written statement to that effect with the Director. Upon receipt of such statement, the Director shall cause an investigation and inspection to be conducted to verify the accuracy of such statement. Upon completion of the investigation and inspection, the Director shall make a determination as to whether an unauthorized mobilehome park closure is underway.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">C.  If the Director determines that an unauthorized mobilehome park closure is underway, the Director shall send a written notice by certified mail to the mobilehome park owner which describes the Director’s determination and establishes a reasonable period of time by which the mobilehome park owner shall submit an application in compliance with this Section for the closure of a mobilehome park.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">D.  Once the Director has determined whether an unauthorized mobilehome park closure is underway, a written notice that describes such determination shall be sent by the County to the mobilehome park owner, mobilehome park manager, the person(s) who filed the written statement in compliance with Subsection B, above, and to all the residents in the mobilehome park.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">E.  The determination of the Director, in compliance with Subsection B, above, may be appealed by the person who filed the statement, by the mobilehome park owner, the mobilehome park manager, or by any other</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="part916.htm#bookmark408" class="s11">interested person within the 10 calendar days following the date of the notice of determination.
