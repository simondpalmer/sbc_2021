Purpose and applicability.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">1.   Purpose. <span class="p">This Section establishes standards that are designed to protect the public health, safety, and welfare, enact strong and effective regulatory and enforcement controls, as a result of and in compliance with State law, protect neighborhood character, and minimize potential for negative impacts on people, communities, and the environment, by establishing minimum land use requirements for medicinal and adult use cannabis activities including cultivation, processing, distribution, manufacturing, testing, and sales.</span></p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s5">2.   Applicability. </span><a href="part984.htm#bookmark450" class="s11">The standards of this Section shall apply to all commercial cannabis activities as defined in </a><a href="part984.htm#bookmark450" class="a">35.110.020 (Definition of Specialized Terms and </a>Phrases) <a href="part97.htm#bookmark14" class="s11">and as may be permitted in compliance with the approval of the applicable permit identified in the Allowed Cannabis Uses and Permit Requirement by Zone Table in this Section, for the listed zones. Commercial cannabis activities shall only be permitted in the AG-I, AG-II, C-1, C-2, C-3, CS, SC, PI, M-RP, M-1, M-2, MU, CM-LA, OT-R/LC, and OT-R/GC zoning districts in compliance with </a><a href="part97.htm#bookmark14" class="a">Article 35.2 (Zones and Allowable Land </a>Uses) <span style=" color: #000;">and the Allowed Cannabis Uses and Permit Requirement by Zone Tables in this Section. Commercial cannabis activities shall also comply with the following:</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">a.   All commercial cannabis activities shall comply with the provisions of this Section, as well as all applicable State laws.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">b.   Nothing in this Section is intended, nor shall it be construed, to allow persons to engage in conduct that endangers others or causes a public nuisance.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">c.   Nothing in this Section is intended, nor shall it be construed, to exempt the cultivation of cannabis from compliance with all other applicable County zoning and land use regulations, as well as other applicable provisions of the County Code, State and local cannabis licensing requirements, or compliance with any applicable State laws.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">d.   All persons operating facilities and conducting commercial cannabis activities, as defined in this Section, are subject to possible Federal prosecution, regardless of State licensure. Any land use or other entitlement from the County does not assert or provide any Federal protections.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">e.   The provisions of this Section shall not be construed to protect any person from prosecution pursuant to any laws that may prohibit the cultivation, sale, distribution, possession, use of and/or any other activity associated with controlled substances, or to authorize conduct that is unlawful under State or Federal law. Moreover, cultivation, sale, possession, distribution, and use of cannabis remain violations of Federal law as of the date of adoption of the ordinance creating this Section and this Section is not intended to, and does not authorize conduct or acts that violate Federal law and does not protect any person from arrest or prosecution under those Federal laws. Persons engaged in cannabis activities assume any and all risk and any and all liability that may arise or result under State and Federal laws from the cultivation, sale, possession, distribution, use of cannabis and/or any other cannabis activity.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">3.   Cannabis activities already are highly regulated by both the state and federal governments, and their regulation of cannabis activities is subject to rapid changes. The Board of Supervisors retains all of its statutory planning and zoning authority concerning cannabis activities. For example, even if the Ordinance (Case No. 17ORD-00000-00004) adding this section becomes operative, the Board of Supervisors still may take action(s) later to change the zoning of cannabis activities to being prohibited. Changing the zoning of cannabis activities to being prohibited, could occur – for example, but is not limited to – if: 1) the County Treasurer is not able to deposit cannabis-related funds in a suitable financial institution; and/or 2) the Board of Supervisors submits a proposed County tax on commercial cannabis activity to the voters and the voters do not approve the tax. In part because cannabis activities are highly regulated by both the state and federal governments and their regulation</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">of cannabis activities is subject to rapid changes, the Board of Supervisors later may need to change the zoning of cannabis activities to being prohibited and may need to do so without cannabis activities receiving: 1) an amortization period; and/or 2) legal nonconforming use status.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part479.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../COUNTY_LUDC_OCTOBER_2021_UPDATE.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part481.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
