If current or previously conducted Phase 1 studies indicate that archaeological or other cultural sites are located in the project area, the applicant shall prepare and submit to the Department for review and approval documentation demonstrating that the resources shall be protected in accordance with applicable cultural resource protection policies. All required studies shall be prepared in accordance with the requirements of the most current County of Santa Barbara Cultural Resources Thresholds and Guidelines, and shall be submitted to the Department for review and approval.
