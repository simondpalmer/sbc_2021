Summary of costs (administrative fees).</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">1.   At the conclusion of the enforcement action, the Director shall send a summary of costs/billing statement associated with enforcement to the owner of the subject property and/or the responsible party by certified mail.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">2.  The summary/billing statement shall include the following information:</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">a.  An advisory of the right to file an appeal of the administrative costs.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">b.  A requirement to submit the written appeal within 10 days of the date of the summary/billing statement.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">c.   An advisory that failure to appeal the administrative fees will eliminate the right to object to the fees and that the owner and/or responsible party will be liable to the County for the assessed charges.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">d.  An advisory that assessed costs can be recovered in a civil action.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">e.   An advisory that the assessed costs can be recovered by recording a lien against the property that is the subject of the enforcement activity and that the amount of the lien may be collected at the same time and in the same manner as property taxes are collected.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">E.  Hearing on objections. <span class="p">Any property owner, or other person having possession and control thereof, who receives a summary of costs/billing statement in compliance with this Section shall have the right to a hearing before the Director on their objections to the proposed costs in compliance with the following procedures.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: left;">1.   A request for a hearing shall be filed with the Department within 10 days of the service by certified mail of the Department’s summary of costs/billing statement.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: left;">2.   Within 30 days of the filing of the request, and on 10 days written notice to the owner, the Director shall hold a hearing on the owner’s objections, and determine the validity of the objections.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: left;">3.   In determining the validity of the costs, the Director shall consider whether total costs are reasonable in the circumstances of the case. Factors to be considered shall include the following:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a.  Whether the present owner created the violation;</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">b.  Whether there is a present ability to correct the violation;</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">c.  Whether the owner moved promptly to correct the violation;</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">d.  The degree of cooperation provided by the owner; and</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">e.  Whether reasonable minds can differ as to whether a violation exists.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part916.htm#bookmark408" class="s11">4.   The Director’s decision shall be appealable to the Board in compliance with </a><a href="part916.htm#bookmark408" class="a">Chapter 35.102 (Appeals)</a><a href="part916.htm#bookmark408" class="s11">.</a></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">5.   In the event that (a) no request for hearing is timely filed or, (b) after a hearing the Director affirms the validity of the costs and an appeal to the Board is not filed in a timely manner, the property owner or person in control and possession shall be liable to the County in the amount stated in the summary/billing statement or any lesser amount as determined by the Director.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">6.   If the costs have not been paid within 45 days of notice thereof, these costs shall be recoverable in a civil action in the name of the County, in any court of competent jurisdiction within the County, or by recording a lien against the property that is the subject of the enforcement activity.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">a.   Except for liens recorded against a property (1) containing an owner-occupied residential dwelling unit or (2) to recover costs associated with an enforcement, abatement, correction, or inspection activity regarding a violation in which the violation was evident on the plans that received a Building Permit, the amount of the proposed lien may be collected at the same time and in the same manner as property taxes are collected. All laws applicable to the levy, collection, and enforcement of ad valorem taxes shall be applicable to the proposed lien, except that if any real property to which the lien would attach has been transferred or conveyed to a bona fide purchaser for value, or if a lien of a bona fide encumbrancer for value has been created and attaches thereon, before the date on which the first installment of taxes would become delinquent, then the lien that would otherwise be imposed by this Section shall not attach to real property and the costs of enforcement relating to the property shall be transferred to the unsecured roll for collection.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">b.   The amount of any cost shall not exceed the actual cost incurred performing the inspections and enforcement activity; the actual cost may include permit fees, fines, late charges, and interest.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">c.   The owner of the property that is the subject of the enforcement activity shall be provided with written notice of the proposed lien, including a description of the basis for the costs comprising the lien, a minimum of 45 days after notice to pay the costs. The notice shall also inform the owner of the ability to appeal the imposition of the proposed lien to the Board regarding the amount of the proposed lien. The notice shall be mailed by certified mail to the last known address of the owner of the property.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">d.   The Board may delegate the holding of the hearing required by this Section to a hearing board designated by the Board. The hearing board may be the Housing Appeals Board established in compliance with Health and Safety Code Section 17920.5 or any other body designated by the Board. The hearing board or body shall make a written recommendation to the Board which shall include factual findings based on evidence introduced at the hearing. The Board may adopt the recommendation without further notice of hearing, or may set the matter for a de novo hearing before the Board. Notice in writing of the de novo hearing shall be provided to the owner of the property that is the subject of the enforcement activity at least 10 days before the scheduled hearing.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">e.   If the Board determines that the proposed lien authorized in compliance with Subsection 6.a., above shall become a lien, the Board may also cause a notice of the lien to be recorded. This lien shall attach upon recordation in the Office of the County Recorder and shall have the same force, priority, and effect as a judgment lien, not a tax lien. The notice shall, at a minimum,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">identify the record owner or possessor of the property, identify the last known address of the record owner or possessor, identify the date upon which the lien was created against the property, and include a description of the real property subject to the lien and the amount of the lien.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part976.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../COUNTY_LUDC_OCTOBER_2021_UPDATE.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part978.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
