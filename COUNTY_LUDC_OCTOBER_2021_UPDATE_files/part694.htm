Purpose. <span class="p">The County shall create a TDR Authority. The purpose of the TDR Authority shall be to:</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">1.   Act as the sole intermediary between transferable development rights/transferable development credit sellers and buyers to facilitate the market between the often disparate values of sending site transferable development rights and receiving site transferable development credits;</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">2.  Manage a fund for continued land preservation with the Transfer of Development Rights program;</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">3.  Hold and/or transfer conservation easements to a third party trustee;</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">4.  Manage and allocate amenity funds;</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">5.  Maintain records of all commodity transactions; and</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">6.  Facilitate the drafting of inter-jurisdictional transferable development rights agreements between County and Participating Entities.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">B.  Administration of the TDR Authority. <span class="p">The County shall designate, by resolution of the Board, the entity which shall be empowered and authorized to serve as the TDR Authority. The entity designated by the County shall be a non-profit organization, among whose purpose it is to conserve open space and/or natural resources of the conservation easement, preferably with experience in administrating TDR programs and conservation easements. The designation may be changed from time to time at the convenience of the Board and shall be formalized by written agreement between the County and the TDR Authority which stipulates the terms and conditions of participation, including, at a minimum, compliance with the provisions of this Chapter.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">C.  Voluntary participation. <span class="p">The purchase and selling price of transferable development rights and credits shall be mutually agreed-upon by the TDR Authority and the seller/buyer of such rights and credits. The</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">valuation methodology shall be established under rules approved by the Board pursuant to Section 35.64.090.J, and neither the TDR Authority, nor the seller/buyer of the transferable development rights or credits shall be obligated to participate in transactions if one or both parties find the valuation inappropriate. For the specific purpose of transferable development credits, the maximum price for each such credit shall calculated as a percentage of land value, sufficiently discounted to induce participation, and shall be established in connection in Section 35.64.090.J.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">D.  Conservation easements. <span class="p">As part of each transaction involving the purchase of development rights, the TDR Authority shall record a conservation easement on the title of the sending site property (or equivalent legally enforceable mechanism). The conservation easement (or equivalent legally enforceable mechanism) must sever, in perpetuity, all rights to develop or use the property except for open space, grazing and agricultural crop production. The TDR Authority shall hold, or transfer to a third party trustee (the “Trustee”) the conservation easement from said property (or equivalent legally enforceable mechanism). The Trustee shall be designated by the Board and shall be a conservation organization, among whose purposes it is to conserve open space and/or natural resources of the conservation easement.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">E.   Sender site priorities. <a href="part689.htm#bookmark309" class="s11">The TDR Authority shall obtain transferable development rights from sending sites in order of priority as set forth by resolution of the Board in Subsection </a><span class="s22">35.64.050</span><span class="p">.A.3. In so doing, the TDR Authority shall be required to purchase transferable development rights from lots with higher priority ranking before purchasing transferable development rights from lots with lower priority ranking. As an example, and by way of illustrative purposes only, if the preservation of bluff lots is selected by the Board as the top priority and the overall estimated development right value of such lots is $115 million, the purchase of development rights shall be restricted to bluff lots until the amount of funds on deposit with the TDR Authority exceed this threshold. Once funds exceed the amount of $115 million, development rights can be purchased from the next highest priority category. In the event no secondary priority is selected, any lot at Naples would be eligible.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">F.  Transferable development credit seller authorization. <a href="part691.htm#bookmark310" class="s11">The TDR Authority can be designated as the sole seller of transferable development credits and shall be allowed to sell transferable development credits to applicants of approved receiving sites as determined in </a><a href="part691.htm#bookmark310" class="a">Section 35.64.060 (Receiving </a><span class="s22">Sites) </span><span class="p">or other interested parties.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">G.  TDR Authority expenditures of funds. <span class="p">The TDR Authority shall only use the revenue collected from the sales of transferable development credits in the following ways:</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1.  Purchase transferable development rights from Naples sending sites.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2.  Allocation of amenity funds.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3.  Cover administrative and overhead costs.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">4.  Repay investment contract obligations made with the TDR Authority.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">5.  Purposes explicitly agreed to by any contract between the County and the TDR Authority.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">H.  TDR Authority management of investment funds. <span class="p">The TDR Authority Board, in addition to buying transferable development rights and selling transferable development credits, may seek to attract private capital and public loans or grants to capitalize the TDR Authority’s revolving fund for continued land preservation.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">I.   Facilitate inter-jurisdictional agreements. <span class="p">The TDR Authority shall serve to facilitate and negotiate with Participating Entities the terms and conditions of any inter-jurisdictional agreement involving the transfer of transferable development rights and/or transferable development credits. The TDR Authority Board shall, prior to finalization of an inter-jurisdictional agreement, seek Board approval of the conditions put forth.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">J.   Adoption of rules<span class="p">. The TDR Authority Board shall adopt bylaws or operating guidelines that include rules for the transaction of business and shall keep a public record of its resolutions, transactions and investments. The bylaws and rules adopted by the TDR Authority Board shall be subject to review and approval by the Board of Supervisors.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Transfer of Development Rights                                     35.64.110</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part693.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../COUNTY_LUDC_OCTOBER_2021_UPDATE.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part695.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
