Height.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">1.   Minimum height. <span class="p">To prevent harmful wind turbulence from existing structures, the minimum height of the lowest part of any horizontal axis wind turbine blade shall be at least 30 feet above the highest structure or tree within a 250-foot radius. Modification of this standard by the review authority may be allowed when the applicant demonstrates that a lower height will not jeopardize the safety of the wind turbine structure.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">F.  Guy wires. <span class="p">Anchor points for any guy wires for a system tower shall be located within the property that the system is located on and not on or across any above-ground electric transmission or distribution lines. The</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">point of attachment for the guy wires shall be enclosed by a fence six feet high or sheathed in bright orange or yellow covering from three to eight feet above the ground.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">G.  Horizontal axis wind turbines. <span class="p">Horizontal axis wind turbines shall be placed at a distance of at least two times the total tower height from any occupied structure. Additionally, the base of the tower shall be setback from all property lines a minimum distance equal to the height of the system, including the wind turbine, provided that it also complies with any applicable fire setback requirements in compliance with Public Resources Code Section 4290.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">H.  Vertical axis wind turbines. <span class="p">Vertical axis wind turbines shall be placed at a distance of at least 10 blade diameters from any structure or tree. A modification may be granted for good cause shown, however, in no case shall the turbine be located closer than three blade diameters to any occupied structure. Additionally, the base of the tower shall be set back from all property lines a minimum distance equal to the height of the system, including the wind turbine, provided that it also complies with any applicable fire setback requirements in compliance with Public Resources Code Section 4290.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">I.   Electromagnetic interference. <span class="p">The system shall be operated so that no electromagnetic interference is caused. If it is demonstrated that a system is causing harmful interference, the system operator shall promptly mitigate the harmful interference or cease operation of the system.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">J.   Color and non-reflective surfaces. <span class="p">The system&#39;s tower and blades shall be painted a non-reflective, unobtrusive color that blends the system and its components into the surrounding landscape to the greatest extent possible and incorporate non-reflective surfaces to minimize any visual disruption.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">K.  Visual impact. <span class="p">The system shall be designed and located in such a manner to minimize adverse visual impacts from public viewing areas (e.g., public parks, roads, trails). To the greatest extent feasible, the wind energy system:</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">1.  Shall not project above the top of ridgelines.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">2.  If visible from public viewing areas, shall use natural landforms and existing vegetation for screening.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">3.   Shall not cause a significantly adverse visual impact to a scenic vista from a County or State designated scenic corridor.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">4.  Shall be screened to the maximum extent feasible by natural vegetation or other means to minimize potentially significant adverse visual impacts on neighboring residential areas.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">L.  Exterior lighting. <span class="p">Exterior lighting on any structure associated with the system shall not be allowed except that which is specifically required by the Federal Aviation Administration.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">M.  Underground electrical wires. <span class="p">Onsite electrical wires associated with the system shall be installed underground except for &quot;tie-ins&quot; to a public utility company and public utility company transmission poles, towers and lines. This standard may be modified by the review authority if the project terrain is determined to be unsuitable due to reasons of excessive grading, biological impacts, or similar factors.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">N.  Signage. <span class="p">At least one sign shall be posted on the tower at a height of five feet warning of electrical shock or high voltage and harm from revolving machinery. No brand names, logo or advertising shall be placed or painted on the tower, rotor, generator or tail vane where it would be visible from the ground, except that a system or tower&#39;s manufacturer&#39;s logo may be displayed on a system generator housing in an unobtrusive manner.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">O.  Access roads. <span class="p">Construction of onsite access roadways shall be minimized. Temporary access roads utilized for initial installation shall be re-graded and re-vegetated to the pre-existing natural condition after completion of installation.</span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part657.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../COUNTY_LUDC_OCTOBER_2021_UPDATE.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part659.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
