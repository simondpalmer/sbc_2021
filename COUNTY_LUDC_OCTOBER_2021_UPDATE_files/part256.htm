Applicability<span class="p">.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">1.   Core Pedestrian Area. <span class="p">The Core Pedestrian Area encourages future commercial and mixed use development in a pattern intended to mimic historic buildings by eliminating building coverage limitations, requiring buildings to be constructed to the front property line, and removing onsite commercial parking space requirements.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">a.   The pedestrian experience in this zone is enhanced with the provision of on-street diagonal parking, reduced pedestrian street crossing distances, and inviting sidewalks and property street frontages.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">b.   The Core Pedestrian Area is generally located on both sides of Clark Avenue from Broadway Avenue to State Highway 135, and on both sides of Broadway Avenue from Clark Avenue to Pinal Avenue.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">2.   Peripheral Pedestrian Area. <span class="p">The Peripheral Pedestrian Area is intended to provide a transition between the downtown commercial neighborhood (the Core Pedestrian Area) and adjacent residential and mixed use zones, while encouraging redevelopment through a reduction in the amount of required onsite parking for commercial uses.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">a.   The proximity of the Peripheral Pedestrian Area to the Core Pedestrian Area is designed to encourage pedestrians to walk between the two areas, as well as for both areas to benefit from enhanced on-street parking resources.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">b.   The Peripheral Pedestrian Area is generally located on the north side of Clark Avenue for the first block west of Broadway Avenue, and also between Pacific Street (on the east), the Core Pedestrian Area (on the west), Pinal Avenue (on the south), and Union Avenue (on the north).</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">3.   Relationship to primary zone. <span class="p">Each land use and proposed development within the PA-OTO overlay zone shall comply with all applicable requirements of the primary zone, in addition to the requirements of this Section. If a requirement of this Section conflicts with a requirement of the primary zone, the requirements of this Section shall take precedence.</span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part255.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../COUNTY_LUDC_OCTOBER_2021_UPDATE.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part257.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
